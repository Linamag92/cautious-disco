<h1>Browser compatibility</h1>

<body>
  <center>Browser compatibility is important when you want
    your website to be smoooth and seamless for the user experience
    across all browsers. It can be Firefor, Internet Explorer,
    Crome or Opera for example. When you developing you use a combination of
    of Javascript, CSS and HTML with CSS3 and HTML5. Later you do a browser test,
    you can simple categorize the features in four parts: base functionality,
    design, accessibililty and responsiveness. But the most common cross browser
    browser problems is for HTML and CSS in lack of support for modern features
    and layout issues. Main issue is older browsers donÂ´t support modern features,
    , especially when you need to support old browser, as an old IE versions.</center>
